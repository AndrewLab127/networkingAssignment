     This function runs the sender, connnect to the server, and send a file to the receiver.
     The function will print the checksum, number of packet sent/recv/corrupt recv/timeout at the end. 
     The checksum is expected to be the same as the checksum that the receiver prints at the end.

     Input: 
        server_ip - IP of the server (String)
        server_port - Port to connect on the server (int)
        connection_ID - your sender and receiver should specify the same connection ID (String)
        loss_rate - the probabilities that a message will be lost (float - default is 0, the value should be between 0 to 1)
        corrupt_rate - the probabilities that a message will be corrupted (float - default is 0, the value should be between 0 to 1)
        max_delay - maximum delay for your packet at the server (int - default is 0, the value should be between 0 to 5)
        tranmission_timeout - waiting time until the sender resends the packet again (int - default is 60 seconds and cannot be 0)
        filename - the path + filename to send (String)

     Output: 
        checksum_val - the checksum value of the file sent (String that always has 5 digits)
        total_packet_sent - the total number of packet sent (int)
        total_packet_recv - the total number of packet received, including corrupted (int)
        total_corrupted_pkt_recv - the total number of corrupted packet receieved (int)
        total_timeout - the total number of timeout (int)
