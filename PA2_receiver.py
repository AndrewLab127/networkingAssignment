     This function runs the receiver, connnect to the server, and receiver file from the sender.
     The function will print the checksum of the received file at the end. 
     The checksum is expected to be the same as the checksum that the sender prints at the end.

     Input: 
        server_ip - IP of the server (String)
        server_port - Port to connect on the server (int)
        connection_ID - your sender and receiver should specify the same connection ID (String)
        loss_rate - the probabilities that a message will be lost (float - default is 0, the value should be between 0 to 1)
        corrupt_rate - the probabilities that a message will be corrupted (float - default is 0, the value should be between 0 to 1)
        max_delay - maximum delay for your packet at the server (int - default is 0, the value should be between 0 to 5)

     Output: 
        checksum_val - the checksum value of the file sent (String that always has 5 digits)
